# AndroidGitProfile
The App accepts a name of user repositories as a query and displays user profile with list of public Github Repositories of a particular user using the Github API. The data is backed by the network data.

I have used MVVM architecture for this application along with Kotlin as Development Language with support of retrofit and Coroutines. 
This sample application using github public api for fetching the user profile and public repo for that user.
